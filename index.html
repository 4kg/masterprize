    <h1>MASTERPRIZE</h1>

    <p>
      MASTERPRIZE is a Go (Baduk) tournament concept focused on real monetary motivation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The core idea is simple: prize money should be accessible not only to top players,
      but to anyone willing to play and improve.
    </p>

    <h2>Concept</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Cash-prize Go tournaments</li>
      <li>Handicap / MacMahon-based formats</li>
      <li>Fair competition across skill levels</li>
      <li>Focus on participation, not elite exclusivity</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why MASTERPRIZE</h2>
    <p>
      Traditional Go tournaments often reward only the strongest players.
      MASTERPRIZE is designed to keep players engaged by making the reward structure
      meaningful for a much wider audience.
    </p>

    <h2>Status</h2>
    <p>
      Project in early development.<br>
      Concept testing and format refinement in progress.
